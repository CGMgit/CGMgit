### 📖 Philosophy & Writing

📘 Author of **_Appleron_ (《苹果论》)** — a philosophical system of **existence, uniqueness, and cognition**.  
Exploring the philosophical structure behind set theory, category theory, and operator theory,  
revealing the “**Trinity of Reason**” that forms the foundation of modern rationality.

> Set theory defines *the container of existence*,  
>
> Logic and model theory define *the rules of truth*,  
>
> Category theory reveals *the motion of structure*.
